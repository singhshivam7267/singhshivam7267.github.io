<!-- Combining Selectors:- -->
<!-- 1:--the first one is with element with class selector. this only affect p tag having class="big" p.big{ font-size: 20px }  As you can see here we have a P element followed immediately without any spaces by a dot big which is a A class selector. And what this expresses is that I want to target every p element that has an attribute class equal to big. Note the lack of space between the element that the class definition. If you do put a space it will mean a completely different combination so make sure that if you want an element that has a class assigned to a particular value that there's no spaces between the first selector and the second selector in this case between the P element selector and the .big class selector. This technique is pretty commonly used when you have a CSS class definition that applies to different elements but when it's applied to a particular element you would like the styling to slightly change. -->
