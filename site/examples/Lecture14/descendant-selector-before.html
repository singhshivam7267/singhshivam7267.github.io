<!-- 3:-Another type of selector id is a descendant selector. And the syntax of it is, selector space another selector. And just like before you read it from right to left. So in this case what we're trying to do is target every P element that is inside at any level. Of an article element, which means that even if it's not a direct child, even if it's deep down, as long as one of its parents in its ancestry is an article, this rule will apply. -->
