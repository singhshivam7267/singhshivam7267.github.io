  <!-- Bootstrap JavaScript depends on jQuery, and that means that we first have to declare jQuery and then we will declare and reference the bootstrap.js. And last, we reference our own JavaScript file, which is likely to be using either the jQuery or the Bootstrap JavaScript files. And again, if you go and actually take a look at that script.js, it's really just an empty file at this point. It's just a placeholder for our future script. Well, let's take a look at what this HTML file looks like in the browser. -->
