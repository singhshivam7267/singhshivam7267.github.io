  &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;

  <!-- It's very often the case that you use images as sort of these anchors within your visual layout of your page. And if this images take time to load, the page might appear jumpy. So this is actually the primary reason why you would want to use the width and the height of the image. You want to tell the browser to reserve this space and to visually partition your page such that it knows that there should be something going on in there even if it takes time to load it -->
